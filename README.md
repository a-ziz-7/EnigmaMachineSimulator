## Introduction
Welcome to the Enigma Machine Simulator project, an interactive web-based simulation of the iconic encryption device used during World War II. This project was developed as part of the Harvard University CS50X course, designed to provide users with a deep understanding of the Enigma machine's operation and encryption principles. 

## Project Overview
The Enigma Machine Simulator is a fully functional representation of the historic encryption device. It offers users the opportunity to explore the 159 quintillion different settings that the original Enigma machine was capable of, making it a valuable educational tool for those interested in cryptography and history.  

## Features
- **Realistic Simulation**: Experience the Enigma machine's encryption process in a faithful, accurate representation of the original device.
- **Interactive Website**: Access the simulator through a user-friendly web interface, making it easy for anyone to use and learn from.
- **Historical Significance**: Gain insight into the workings of the Enigma machine, a critical tool in the history of cryptography.
- **CS50X Project**: This project served as an accomplishment, completing the rigorous CS50X course in just four weeks.

## Technologies
The Enigma Machine Simulator project incorporates the following technologies:
- HTML: For the project's structure and user interface.
- CSS: Styling and design to create a visually appealing website.
- JavaScript: Implementation of the Enigma machine's functionality.
- Python: Used for various backend tasks and calculations.
- Wireframes: Early design concepts for the project.
- Encryption: Providing an interactive platform for learning encryption principles.
